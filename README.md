Drawing shape file polygons on MapKit

Simple & strightforward  test of loading shape file and drawing it on MapKit using drawMapRect. 
no storyboard, no pods, plain project using shapelib 

- draws only polygons so far
- primitive optimization, no scale optimization

drawing approach is taken from this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17673410/mkmapview-with-multiple-overlays-memory-issue
other inspiration from http://www.al-tyus.com/blog/2013/10/14/mapkit-and-esri-shapefiles
